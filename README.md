#CODSOFT INTERNSHIP OF DATA SCIENCE

CODSOFT Data Science Internship Portfolio
Welcome to my Data Science Internship Portfolio! This repository showcases the projects I completed during my internship at Codsoft. Each project demonstrates my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and problem-solving. Letâ€™s dive into the details:

Project Summaries

Titanic Survival Detection
Objective: Predict passenger survival on the Titanic.
Steps:
Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical features).
Exploratory data analysis (visualizing patterns, correlations).
Building a machine learning model (e.g., logistic regression, random forest) for survival prediction.

Movie Rating Prediction with Python
Objective: Develop a movie rating prediction system.
Steps:
Data collection (movie ratings dataset).
Data preprocessing (cleaning, feature engineering).
Building a predictive model (regression or recommendation system).

Iris Flower Classification
Objective: Classify iris flowers into species.
Steps:
Using the classic Iris dataset.
Feature extraction (sepal and petal measurements).
Applying machine learning algorithms (e.g., k-nearest neighbors, decision tree).

Sales Prediction using Python
Objective: Predict future sales for a business.
Steps:
Data preprocessing (handling outliers, scaling features).
Time series analysis (seasonal decomposition, trend detection).
Building a predictive model (e.g., ARIMA, XGBoost).

Credit Card Fraud Detection
Objective: Identify fraudulent credit card transactions.
Steps:
Handling class imbalance (oversampling, undersampling).
Feature engineering (extracting relevant features).
Building a classification model (logistic regression, random forest).

Technologies Used
Languages: Python, SQL
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
